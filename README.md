# NeuralNets

### Project description

A repository with some of the resources I used to practice implementing neural networks.


### Objective

Practicing implementing neural networks.


### Requires

Notebooks:
* jupyter notebook/lab  https://jupyter.org/install

Tutorial implementation:
* python 3.5-3.8
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* tensorflow 2.2.0 <=

### More info


The notebooks feature an array of practice exercises for implementing Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.

The *breast-cancer-calssification* folder is an implementation of the tutorial from pyimagesearch.com:
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/02/18/breast-cancer-classification-with-keras-and-deep-learning/  
The goal is to train a CNN using breast histopathology images (from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images/) 
to predict if a sample shows invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), the most common of all breast cancer.



### Future improvements

* Implementation of the Deep Mind's Differentiable Neural Computer architecture (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101).
